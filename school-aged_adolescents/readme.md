# Waist Circumference Assessment Tool

This tool calculates waist circumference percentiles for school-aged children and adolescents, helping to evaluate growth and assess cardiovascular and metabolic risk.

## Reference Standards

Percentile calculations are based on the following reference:

> Fernández JR, Redden DT, Pietrobelli A, Allison DB. Waist circumference percentiles in nationally representative samples of African-American children.

## Methodology

The assessment methodology and evaluation criteria are adapted from:

> **EVALUACIÓN NUTRICIONAL DEL CRECIMIENTO Y DEL RIESGO CARDIOVASCULAR Y METABÓLICO**  
> Autora: M. Gladys Barrera A. (2018)

## Purpose

This resource is designed to support healthcare professionals and researchers in the nutritional assessment of schoolchildren and adolescents, with a focus on identifying growth patterns and potential cardiovascular or metabolic risks using standardized waist circumference percentiles.

## Waist Circumference Percentile Tables

The following tables provide waist circumference percentiles (in centimeters) for children and adolescents aged 2-18 years. These percentiles help assess whether a child's waist circumference falls within normal ranges or indicates potential health risks.

### Understanding the Percentiles

- **10th percentile**: Lower range of normal
- **25th percentile**: Lower-middle range of normal  
- **50th percentile**: Median/average value
- **75th percentile**: Upper-middle range of normal
- **90th percentile**: Upper range of normal

Values above the 90th percentile may indicate increased risk for cardiovascular and metabolic complications.

## Clinical Interpretation

These tables are based on nationally representative samples and provide reference values for assessing waist circumference in children and adolescents. Healthcare professionals can use these percentiles to:

1. **Monitor Growth**: Track normal development patterns over time
2. **Identify Risk**: Values consistently above the 90th percentile may indicate increased cardiovascular and metabolic risk
3. **Guide Interventions**: Help determine when lifestyle interventions may be beneficial
4. **Research Applications**: Standardize measurements in pediatric nutrition studies

## Important Notes

- Measurements should be taken at the narrowest point of the waist or at the midpoint between the lowest rib and the iliac crest
- Multiple measurements over time provide better assessment than single readings
- Consider family history, ethnicity, and other risk factors when interpreting results
- These tables are based on specific population samples and may need adjustment for different ethnic groups
